## FAQ

### Will the limits of GTA:V be increased?

Yes, alt:V has already increased certain limits compared to the original GTA V.
If you find the need to further increase a specific limit, it can be achieved using a resource packed in the RPF format.
For detailed instructions on how to increase limits using an RPF resource, please refer to the tutorial available [here](PLACEHOLDER LINK).

### Does alt:V work on Linux?

While there are native builds of the alt:V server available for Linux, it's important to note that the alt:V client does not have official support for Linux.
However, some users have reported success running alt:V with compatibility layers such as Wine or Proton.
If you decide to give it a try, you can attempt to run alt:V by installing both GTA V and alt:V within the same Wine prefix.
For further questions, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/altv) and ask in the [altV on Linux](https://discord.com/channels/371265202378899476/988474811258908702) thread.

It's important to note that there are ongoing plans to release additional components of alt:V as open-source in the future.
