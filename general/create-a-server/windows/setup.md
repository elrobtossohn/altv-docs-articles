### Before installation

Before we can really get started, you should create a user.  
We use “altv” as the user in the article, but you can choose your own name.

Please read [this post](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1389054/how-do-i-set-up-user-accounts-and-manage-permissio) and switch after creating to the account.

:::warning

The server should never run with an administrator user.

:::

In the following steps, we will install and start the server.  
We use `C:/ALTV-SERVER` as the directory, but you are free to choose your own directory.

Create and go to the `C:/ALTV-SERVER` directory

### Download (Using altv-pkg)

Visit the [alt:V Downloads page](https://altv.mp/downloads/) and scroll down to the server selection.  
Select `altv-pkg` in the tab and follow the instructions.

### Download & Upload (Using FTP)

Visit the [alt:V Downloads page](https://altv.mp/downloads/) and scroll down to the server selection.

1. Select **Windows x64** under `Server OS`.
2. Under Modules you can now select everything you need.  
   2.1 You do not have to select all modules, as a beginner we recommend the **JS Module** (JavaScript Module).
3. Select `Data files` and `Sample server config`.  
   3.1 The item “Example resource pack” is not relevant.
4. Click on **Download Server** to download the Server.

#### Unpack
