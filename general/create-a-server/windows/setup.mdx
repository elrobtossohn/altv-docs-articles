### Before installation

Before we can really get started, you should create a user.  
We use “altv” as the user in the article, but you can choose your own name.

Please read [this post](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1389054/how-do-i-set-up-user-accounts-and-manage-permissio) and switch after creating to the account.

:::warning

The server should never run with an administrator user.

:::

In the following steps, we will install and start the server.  
We use `C:/ALTV-SERVER` as the directory, but you are free to choose your own directory.

Create and go to the `C:/ALTV-SERVER` directory

### Download

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yourself" label="Yourself">

Visit the [alt:V Downloads page](https://altv.mp/downloads/) and scroll down to the server selection.

1. Select **Windows x64** under `Server OS`.
2. Under Modules you can now select everything you need.
   2.1 You do not have to select all modules, as a beginner we recommend the **JS Module** (JavaScript Module).
3. Select `Data files` and `Sample server config`.
   3.1 The item “Example resource pack” is not relevant.
4. Click on **Download Server** to download the Server.

#### Unpack
1. Open the downloaded archive. (`altv-server.zip`)
2. Unpack the `altv-server.zip` archive with WinRAR or 7-ZIP.

Here is an example of how you can download an alt:V server with [altv-pkg](https://github.com/altmp/altv-pkg).
With this tool you can also keep all files up-to-date without having to download the files yourself.

1. Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Create the file `.altvpkgrc.json` in the `C:/ALTV-SERVER` directory
    The content should look like this:
    ```json
    {
        "loadJSModule": true,
        "loadBytecodeModule": false,
        "loadCSharpModule": false,
        "loadJSV2Module": false,
        "loadVoiceServer": false
    }
    ```
3. Open an terminal in the desired folder and use the following command:
    ```
    npx altv-pkg release
    ```


You may also read the README file in the [altv-pkg Repository](https://github.com/altmp/altv-pkg).
