<span class="badge badge--secondary">This feature were added in version 16.0</span>

In alt:V 16 we introduced the mods folder for mods such as [Reshade](https://reshade.me) and [ENB](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_gta5.htm).<br/>
RPF files do **not** belong in this folder but still in the Grand Theft Auto V installation folder.

:::warning Support

We do offer to run some modifications in this folder, but we do **not** offer support for them.
If your game crashes or you have other problems, you will have to fix them yourself.

:::

:::info

Modifications can be automatically deactivated by alt:V during recurring crashes or stress tests for stability.

## Usage

### Enable support for the Mods folder

In order for the mods to be loaded from the mods folder, it must first be activated.
Follow the steps below or [click here](altv://action/setcfg?enableModDirectory=true):

1. Navigate to your alt:V directory
2. Open the `altv.toml` file with a text editor
3. Look for a line which starts with `enableModDirectory`
   1. If it exists, change its value to `true`
   2. If it doesn't exist, add `enableModDirectory = true` at the bottom of the file
4. Save the changes to the `altv.toml` file

### Adding mods

To add new mods simply put their files into the mods folder. You can open this by clicking [here](altv://action/open/mods) or navigating to your alt:V directory and then the `mods` directory. If the directory doesn't exist, create it yourself.

Place the mod and it's related files (e.g. `*.dll`, `*.ini`, `*.fx` and other relevant files) into the mods folder.
Remind that RPF files don't belong into this directory, see next step.
