# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the alt:V documentation!
Here's a guide to help you get started:

## New articles

### Prepare the article

To prepare a new article for the alt:V documentation, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "docs" directory
2. Select the category you want to add the article to
   - If the article you're working on belongs to an existing category, navigate to the corresponding directory within the docs folder
   - If the article belongs to a new category, create a new directory in the docs folder. When creating a new directory, ensure that a _category_.json file is also created within it. This JSON file should contain the following information:
       ```
       {
           "position": Insert the numeric value of the categories sidebar order here,
           "label": "Display Name of the New Category"
       }
       ```
3. Create a new article file
    - The file name should be the same as the article title, but in lowercase and with dashes instead of spaces
    - If you plan to use only markdown, use ".md" as file extension
    - If you plan to use JSX, use ".mdx" as file extension
4. Add the sidebar meta data
    Add the following meta data to the top of the file:
    ```
    ---
    title: "The Document Title"
    sidebar_position: Insert the numeric value of the articles sidebar order here
    ---
    ```

Now you can get started with writing your article and adding the necessary content.
